# America-s-favorite-cuisine-Altair
In this tutorial, I demonstrate the transformation from a survey data to a long-form dataframe, then use this dataframe to create a complete heatmap with considerations of aesthetic features.

I will be using the Food World Cup dataset by FiveThirtyEight. This is the dataset assocciated with two of their articles : The FiveThirtyEight International Food Association’s 2014 World Cup and What is Americans’ Favorite Global Cuisine?
